With SVM we have the possibility to apply new kernels that allows flexibility for our decision boundaries, leading to a better classification performance.\n",

    " - Weaknesses: It does not have good performance when we have heterogenous datasets and many independent features, and datasets with a lot of data. \n",

    "**2) Decision Trees**\n",

    " - General Applications: Decision Trees are a non-parametric supervised learning method used for classification and regression. The goal is to create a model that predicts the value of a target variable by learning simple decision rules inferred from the data features.\n",

    " - Strengths: The advantage of a decision trees is the possibility of decomposition of a complex problem in several simpler sub-problems. Recursively, a new identified sub-problems can again broken down into even simpler sub-problems.\n",

    " - Weaknesses: Decision Trees do not work well if we have smooth boundaries.  i.e they work best when we have discontinuous piece wise constant model. If we truly have a linear target function decision trees are not the best.\n",

    "**3) Naive Bayes**\n",

    "\n",
    " - Strengths: The advantages of naive bayes are that it provides very simple representation and doesn't allow for rich hypotheses and also Naive Bayes classifier will converge quicker than discriminative models like logistic regression, so we need less training data. \n",

The model uses data from the students (age, gender, family, etc.) to make predictions on the new students' data. The model will undergo a training process with the data of these students so that the model can create a function able to set a decision boundary between a set of students who failed and those who managed to pass.We call this function of separation between the two classes, a hyperplane.After establishing a function that separates our classe well for the model, we introduce the model to the new data from the newly arrived students.
